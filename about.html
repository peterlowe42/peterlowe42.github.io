        I am originally form just outside Liverpool in the UK.  I studied Mechanical Engineering at The University Of Manchester but after getting my bachelors I did not feel inspired to pursue a career in engineering.  Instead I decided I wanted to pursue my passion for scuba diving and become a scuba instructor.  I trained as an instructor in Nah Trang, Vietnam and spent the next five and half years working in the dive industry all over the world.  I've worked in Panama, Costa Rica, Thailand and the British Virgin Islands.  As well as teaching diving I'm also a keen underwater photographer and videographer.

        I enjoyed my time in the dive industry immensely but sadly it's very much a young mans game and provides very little in terms of financial security.  I decided that at the age of thirty it's about time I stopped living like a crazy nomad and settled down to become a regular tax paying member of society.  I also figured that having access to health care might be nice.  I was introduced to the idea of devbootcamp and started playing around with code to see if it was for me.  I found coding to be surprisingly fun and interesting and found myself getting very absorbed in coding problems.  This seemed like a good sign so I signed up for DBC and though I sometimes miss my old life underwater I'm looking forward to a long and fruitful career in web development.

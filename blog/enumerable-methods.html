        <p>
           Ruby is packed with useful built in methods designed to make your life as a programmer easier.  One of these methods is the enumerable method '.map'.  If you spend much time working with ruby you will no doubt find many uses for this awesome and handy method.
        </p>
      
        <h2>What is .map and what does it do?</h2>
      
        <p>
         .map is an iterative method that can work with any collection object in ruby but it is mostly used with arrays.  Put simply map iterates over an array and passes each element in turn to a code block much like the method '.each'. Unlike '.each' '.map' returns a new array containing the results of this iteration. 
        </p>
      
        <h2>How do I use .map</h2>

        <p>You can call 'map' by adding .map to the name of the array you want to call it on followed by the code block you want 'map' to run.  Like so:
        </p>
       
        <pre class="code">
         <code>
         array_name.map {code block}
         </code>
        </pre>
      
        <p class="caption">
          Imagine you have an array of numbers and you want to find the squares of all those numbers.  The map method would do this for you easily.   For the sake of this example we will use an array of the numbers 1 to 4.

        <pre class="code">
         <code>
         array = [1,2,3,4]
         array.map {|i| i*i}     #=> [1,4,9,16]
         </code>
        </pre>
            
        <p>
          In this case map takes each element in 'array' and adds it's square to a new array. It then returns this array.
        </p>

        <h2>So why not just .each?</h2>
      
        <p>
          .each is a great method and is usually the first method you'd consider for iteration but the problem with each is JUST passes each element to  code block.  Unless you specifically tell it to it will not do anything with the results.  For example to get the same array of squares using .each we would have to use the following. 
       </p>
      
        <pre class="code">
        <code>
         array = [1,2,3,4]
         squares_array = []
         array.each {|i| squares_array << i*i } 
         squares_array      #=> [1,4,9,16]
        </code>
        </pre>
      
        <p>
         Notice that we had to create a new array to put the results in and modify the code block to add the result of i*i to this new array whereas .map did all of this for us.  So now you know if you want to return an array of results from an iteration save yourself some hassle and use .map instead of .each. </p>

How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

  We didn't do that much wireframing during the exercise I already had an outline sketched out and we pretty much just went of that. I think for me at least wireframing as a pair would work much better in person with a witeboard or flipchart to brainstorm on. I enjoyed writing the HTML as a pair. I was driving for most of the exercise and there were a few times when Lyndsy spotted errors in my code right away that I don't think I would have noticed if I was coding alone.  This was pretty cool and really made it clear why pair coding is so popular in the industry. 

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

   Yes. Wireframing gives a clear idea of what you're trying to build. We referred back to my wireframe several times during the process to make sure we were adding all the elements we needed. 

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

    A wireframe should be clear and simple and that it should be imediately obvious to any web user what everything in the wireframe is/does. 

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
    
    I didn't learn any new elements in this exercise. But I did re-use the dropdown menu code that I learned in my solo challenge.

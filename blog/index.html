	Hi and Welcome to my technical blog.  The purpose of this blog is for me to share my knowledge and ideas about various technical topics. The topics will mostly relate to web development but who knows maybe i'll wake up one morning with the unshakable desire to write a blog post about the merits of various spaceship designs or why sharks are cooler than bears.  If i do write such a post I promise to share it with you here.  This is the first blog I have have ever attempted to write so don't expect masterful writing or perfect grammar.  All I can promise is that I will do my best to convey my ideas in a coherent fashion.  To enjoy the wonders of my amazing new blog please select a topic from the list provided.

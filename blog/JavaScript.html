        <p>So this week I have delved into the wonderful world of JavaScript and am writing a short blog post about how it differs from Ruby.  Obviously there are a lot of differences between the two languages but I'm going to focus on the differences in the syntax for flow control and looping.  More specify I will focus on the what I consider to be the most obvious suprising, the complete lack of the keyword 'end'. 
        </p>
      
       
      
        <p>
          Ruby relies heavily on the keyword 'end' to mark the end of if statements, loops, definitions pretty much anything that has an end point will be closed by 'end'.  In javaScript there is no need for 'end' instead everything that would normally require an 'end' statement in ruby is enclosed in curly braces.  Consider the following example of a simple 'if' statement written first in ruby then in javaScript.
        </p>
      
        <pre class="code">
          <code>
           #Ruby
            if num == 3
            num += 1
            puts “Three is a great number but four is even better”
            else
            puts “Thats not a very good number”
            end

            //javaScript
            if (num == 3){
            num += 1;
            console.log(“Three is a great number but four is even better”);
            }
            else 
            console.log(“Thats not a very good number”);
          </code>
        </pre>
      
        
        
        <p>This is a very pointless piece of code but it illustrates the point well notice how in the javaScript version the code that would run if num is equal to three is contained within curly braces and there is no 'end' statement.  Note that I have not used braces after the else statement this is because the braces are only needed if you want more than one statement to run.  If there are no braces after an 'if' or 'else' keyword javaScript will only run the first statement after and then assume that this is where you want it to end. The same method is used to define the code used in a loop.  
        </p>
       
        <pre class="code">
         <code>
          //JavaScript
          for (var i=0;  I <= 10 ; I += 1) {
          console.log(i)
          console.log(“ “)
          }
         </code>
        </pre>
      
        
        <p>
          This will print the numbers 1 -10 with blank lines in between.  
        </p>

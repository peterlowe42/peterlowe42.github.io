        <h2>What is a class?</h2>
        <p>
         Put simply a class is a 'type' of object in ruby.  There are many classes already built into ruby like Array, String, Integer, Hash etc (As you can see class names start with a capita letter).   Every time you create a string in ruby you are creating an instance of the class String.  Each class comes with an bunch of methods that can be called on any instance of that class.  You don't just have to stick with the built in  ruby classes, you can also create your very own custom classes.  
        </p>
      
        <h2>How Do I Create a Class?</h2>
      
        <p>
          You can make classes for almost anything.  I was going to use a Christmas themed example but then I realized that for me at least Christmas this year has been over shadowed by a much more important event.  The release of Star Wars VII.  So lets forget about Christmas for a minute and focus on droids instead.  I'm going to show you how to make a new class called Droid and give it a couple of methods that can be called on any instance of the class.  Lets start out by defining the class:
        </p>
      
        <pre class="code">
          <code>
            class Droid
             def initialize (name)
             @name = name
            end 
            end
          </code>
        </pre>
      
        
        <p>Notice that I've also defined a method called initialize.  This should always be defined at the start of the class to tell ruby what variables each instance of the class must start with.  Every time you make a new instance of a class ruby will run the initialize method.   I've kept this one nice and simple, since every droid needs a name our initialize method takes an input name and assigns it to an instance variable @name.  An instance variable is similar to a regular variable only it is defined within a class and can be called from any other method. This  means that once we have defined out droids name we can use it outside the initialize method. (all instance variables start with @)
        </p>
        <p>Now lets make our Droid talk:</p>
        <pre class="code">
         <code>
          class Droid
            def initialize (name)
              @name = name
            end 

            def talk
              if @name == "C3PO"
                 p "I am C3PO, human cyborg relations"
              elsif @name == "R2D2"
                 p "Beep, Beep , BEEEP!!"
              else
                p "Gonk..Gonk"
              end
            end
          end
         </code>
        </pre>
      
     
      
        <p>
         We now have a new method that we can call on any instance of Droid.   This will make our Droid say familiar catch phrases if it's name is R2D2 or C3PO otherwise it will just say “Gonk..Gonk”. Now lets add one more method before we test things.  What happens if we are looking for our droids?
      
        
      
        <pre class="code">
        <code>
            class Droid
              def initialize (name)
              @name = name
              end 

              def talk
               if @name == "C3PO"
                 p "I am C3PO, human cyborg relations"
               elsif @name == "R2D2"
                 p "Beep, Beep , BEEEP!!"
               else
                 p "Gonk..Gonk"
             end
             end



            def look_for
              if @name == "R2D2" || @name == "C3PO"
                p "These aren't the droids you're looking for"
              else 
               p "You have found #{@name}!"
              end
            end
  
          end

        </code>
        </pre>
      
        <p>
          We now have a new method look_for that will let us find some droids but not others. 
        </p>

        <p>
          OK now lets test this new class by making some droids.  In the same ruby file where we defined this class we can now make some instances of it. 
        </p>

        <pre class="code">
          <code>
            r2 = Droid.new("R2D2")
            c3po = Droid.new("C3PO")
            gonk = Droid.new ("Gonk")
        </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          Now what happens if we call some of our methods. 
        </p>

         <pre class="code">
          <code>
            >c3po.talk  
            > "I am C3PO, human cyborg relations"
            >r2.talk
            > "Beep, Beep , BEEEP!!"
          </code>
        </pre>
         <p>
          So it looks like our talk method is working.  Now let's try looking for some droids.
        </p>
             <pre class="code">
          <code>
           >gonk.look_for
           >"You've found Gonk!"
           >r2.look_for
           >"These aren't the droids you're looking for."
          </code>
        </pre>

      <p>
        So hopefully now you understand a little about how to set up a class and give it methods.

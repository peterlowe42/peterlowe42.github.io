        <p> Rails is a web application framework designed to be used alongside ruby, in fact it is written in Ruby.  In essensce it is a software library that adds extra functionality to the Ruby language with the aim of simplifying and speeding up the process of developing complex websites.   It does this by making assumptions about the kind of things that every web developer needs.   
        </p>
      
       
      
        <p>
          Rails is an 'opinionated' application meaning that there is often a 'rails way' of solving a particular problem and although it may be possible to solve it another way this could cause problems and it will make using rails more difficult.  As you can imagine this is not popular with everyone but having a strict set of conventions allows developers who have been trained 'the rails way' to collaborate more easily. 
        </p>
   
            
        <p>The result of this is that Rails has become more than just a framework. It has spawned a vast community of developers who collaborate, share code, support each-other and even contribute to the development of the  Rails application itself.  This means that Rails developers can spend less time writing tedious code because many of the features they want have already been built.   

        </p>
       
        <h2>Rails Principles</h2>
        
        <p>
          <b>Don't Repeat Yourself(DRY):</b> The DRY principal is based on the idea that "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system."  This means that if your planning on using the same functionality in several places within your program the code for this must be defined in only one place and then be referred back to rather than written out again.  This makes programs much easier to modify and reduces the possibility of bugs.   
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Convention over Configuration:</b>  Rather than relying on configuration files to specify how certain tasks are performed Rails has universal conventions.  This reduces coding time and means that apps written in rails can be more easily understood by anyone who knows the 'rails way'.  
        </p>

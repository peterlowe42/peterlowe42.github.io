What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

  Padding is extra space beween an element and its border.  It can often be handy for making an element take up more space on the screen. Padding takes on whatever background color you've assigned to that object. 
  Borders are pretty much what you would expect them to be i.e. borders around an object. You can set the thickness and type of border. 
  A margin is invisible space around the object outside the border. It is generaly used to help space objects out. 

What did you learn about CSS positioning?

  In practice it is strange and unpredictable but in theory it works like this:
  CSS positoning comes in several forms, absolutle, relative, static and fixed.  Static is the default position asigned to the object. Absolute postioning is used to define an objects exact positon in relation to it's nearest positioned ancestor.  If the object has no positioned ancestors it will be positioned relative to the page itself.  Relative positioning positions an object relative to wherever it would otherwise have been. and fixed positioning positions an element relative to the viewport so it will remain static when the page is scrolled. 


What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

  Aside form simple things like font size nothing was easy. CSS is a fickle mistress and has a nasty habbit of rearanging things in ways that no reasonable human would ever expect or desire. 

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

  It is a tedious and horrible process but if you stick at and apease the proper deitys it evenually you'll eventually reach a result that is at least close to what you wanted. Also it really helps if you included proper divs in your HTML from the start.
